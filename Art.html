			<h2>Committee's Mission</h2>
			Being part of an art committee can be a rewarding experience for those who are passionate about art and want to make a positive impact in their community. It provides an opportunity to connect with other like-minded individuals, learn new skills, and contribute to the cultural and artistic landscape of their community.

Art committees play an important role in promoting creativity and artistic expression in their communities. They help to bring people together through the appreciation of art and create opportunities for artists to share their work with a wider audience. By promoting art education and appreciation, art committees also help to inspire the next generation of artists and creatives.
			<p>Whether you  a beginner, we welcome you to join us in our journey to promote and celebrate Art comittee!</p>
